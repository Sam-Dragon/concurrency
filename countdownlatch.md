# CountDownLatch

- It makes sure all the threads must be completed inorder to complete the process
- It happens only once & is not re-usable
- Always good to use timeouts else we can go in infinite loop

Example:

- Exam Room
  > Generally, till all the students finish the exam, teacher cannot go out &
  > it has to make sure all the students have finished exam in stipulated time
